# Agentic Workbench Protocol (v0)

This module defines the canonical, governed lifecycle for artifacts
(agent assemblies, policies, claims, releases) used across the sociosphere.

Invariant:
The artifact is the atom of reality.

This protocol is:
- model-agnostic
- runtime-agnostic
- Linux-compatible but not Linux-bound
