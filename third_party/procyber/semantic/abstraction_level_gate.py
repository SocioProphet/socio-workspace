"""Abstraction-level gate (S5 instrument) — measure the mismatch the board never did.

The KKO tiered-grounding arm came back inert: grounding fired on 345/350 rows and
moved the score +0.3pp (noise). The lesson was not "grounding is useless" — it was
that nobody measured the quantity grounding was supposed to fix: the
**abstraction-level mismatch rate**, the rate at which an intro-level query is bound
to a graduate-level topic.

This gate measures exactly that over `bind_tiered`, and it has teeth in BOTH
directions, because a one-sided control is not a control:

  * it FAILS if the binder admits a cross-abstraction match (`mismatch_rate` too high);
  * it FAILS as **vacuous** if the binder never admits a correct same-tier match, or
    never abstains on a trap — a binder that abstains on everything scores a perfect
    zero mismatch and is worthless. A control that has only ever passed, or only ever
    fired, is suspect.
  * it FAILS if run below `min_n` — an unfalsifiable sample is not evidence.

`bind_fn` is a parameter so the gate can be pointed at a deliberately broken binder
and shown to catch it; that is the gate's own teeth-both-ways evidence.
