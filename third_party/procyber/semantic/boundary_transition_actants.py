"""BoundaryTransition v0.2 — the nine actantial roles, validated.

The actantial frame (Tesnière's actants + case grammar) is a complete,
non-redundant frame for a governed action: who, to what, for whom, by what and
why, when, where, to what purpose, how. It is universal linguistics, not any
third party's IP, and it replaces the ad-hoc field sets of v0.1 with one closed
role inventory.

`skeleton()` returns the frame's STRUCTURE with the natural-language surface of
every role dropped. Structure travels; surface does not — that is the mechanism
for transmitting event shape to a counterparty while withholding the descriptor
(the linkability / de-identification lever).
