"""Clean-room guard — fail the build if a framework artifact names a third-party
metalanguage or its author.

The clean-room posture ("take the algebra, leave the lexicon; keep the comparison in
the internal register, never in this repo") was, until now, a prose promise. A control
that is only asserted is not a control. This mechanizes it: run it in CI over the
framework's own files and it exits non-zero on any leak.

Self-exclusion: this file and its test necessarily contain the forbidden tokens (the
patterns they scan for, and the fixtures that prove they bite), so they are never
scanned. A scanner that flags itself is broken — see the estate rule that a
self-validating checker must exclude itself.
