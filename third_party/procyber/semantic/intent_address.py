"""The bridge: the 23x6 intent grid as a slice of the coordinate algebra.

The intent grid (Noetica `agent-machine/lib/intent-grid.ts`) is a derived, grounded,
falsifiable capability matrix — but it is *flat*: it has no metric on its rows (which
intents are near?) and no abstraction ordering. This module lifts each intent row into
a `SemanticAddress`, so the grid inherits exactly the two properties it lacked and the
kernel already has:

  * a computed metric — intents that do the same kind of work (share a column) cluster
    at distance 1; intents in different columns sit at distance 2. Nothing learned,
    nothing curated per pair.
  * a layer — the meta row `conversation_objective` is *second-order* (its operand is
    an action, not a topic), so its address is built one layer up, out of an action
    address. The self-referential row is a genuine fixed point in the grading.

And it makes the grid's headline finding structural: `sense` (world:read) is the
estate's thinnest column. Route a world:read query when the sense intents are absent
and `bind_tiered` returns BOTTOM — the wiring gap becomes an honest abstention, not a
silent mis-route.

The column algebra, made explicit: a column = a polarity (read=pullback / write=pushout)
over a substrate, and the three substrates are Peircean — held=Firstness (the present
working register), world=Secondness (brute external fact), store=Thirdness (the
persisted, mediating law). Six columns = two dual operators x three substrates.

This is a demonstration/bridge in the algebra's own repo; it encodes the intent roster
as data (the canon lives in Noetica) and does not import from Noetica.
