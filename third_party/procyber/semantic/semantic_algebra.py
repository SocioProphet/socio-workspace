"""Compositional semantic algebra — the coordinate kernel (S0-S2).

A graded, non-commutative algebra for *addressing meaning by structure*, so that
semantic distance is COMPUTED from form rather than learned from a corpus. It is
the substrate for two things the estate already needs and does not have:

  1. AgentCoordinateVector — the eleven axes every agent declares itself on, so
     that "what kind of work is this" is a typed value instead of a convention.
  2. SemanticAddress       — a concept address carrying BOTH its intension (how
     it decomposes) and its extension (what it refers to: a KKO/KBpedia IRI),
     plus the warrant for believing it.

Why an algebra at all
---------------------
The measured failure this exists to fix: the keyed-vec topic space is flat, so
an intro-physics query matched a graduate QFT topic — 94.9% vocab hit but topic
max-cos only 0.38-0.54. Abstraction level was not representable, so it could not
be enforced. Here `layer` is a SYNTACTIC property of the address: a cross-layer
match is not discouraged by a threshold, it is structurally impossible (see
`bind_tiered` and its rejection test). That is the whole point.

Primitives and their provenance
-------------------------------
The generating set is forced by the mathematics, not chosen for flavour: to
generate a lattice by symmetry you need a neutral element, one binary symmetry,
and one ternary symmetry. We take ours from the public-domain sources this
estate is ALREADY aligned to, which is why the algebra lands natively on KKO:

  NIL         neutral element                       (algebraic necessity)
  POT / ACT   potentiality / actuality              (Aristotle) -> kko:Matter/Forms
  FST/SND/TRD Firstness / Secondness / Thirdness    (Peirce, 1890s) -> KKO spine

The ternary product's three roles are `ground` (what it stands on), `differentia`
(what distinguishes it) and `mode` (how it is qualified) — Aristotelian
genus/differentia plus the Spinozan mode. See docs/SEMANTIC_COORDINATE_ALGEBRA.md
for the full provenance register; every element traces to a public-domain source.

Pure and local-first: stdlib only, no network. An addressing kernel in the hot
path of every retrieval and every boundary crossing must not take a round-trip.

Conformance notes
-----------------
* Terms are immutable and hashable; equality is structural.
* `add` is commutative and normalised (sorted canonical form), so no two
  formally different expressions denote the same set.
* `mul` is NON-commutative and raises on mixed-layer operands — layer discipline
  is enforced at construction, not checked afterwards.
* `pullback` (limit / restrict) and `pushout` (colimit / glue) are duals and are
  the only two ways to combine knowledge. `meet` reconciles them. One meet
  implementation serves both this kernel and Truth = Law x Evidence.
* Abstention is a first-class value, `BOTTOM`, not `None`: `bind_tiered` and
  `pullback` return it, `meet` absorbs it, and its position is undefined under
  `distance`. Incompleteness makes abstention structural, so it is carried, not
  smuggled through the control flow.
* The verdict lattice is DERIVED from `VERDICT_CLEARS` (what each verdict clears)
  by `derive_verdict_order`, not hand-authored; it raises unless the verdicts form
  a chain. There is no second copy of the ordering to drift from its meaning.
